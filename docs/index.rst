Quart is a Python web microframework based on Asyncio. It is intended
to provide the easiest way to use asyncio in a web context, especially
with existing Flask apps. If you are new to Python you should start by
reading :ref:`installation`, if you are new to Quart then see
:ref:`quickstart` and if you are also new to Asyncio see
:ref:`asyncio`. If however you are very familiar with Flask, see
:ref:`flask_migration`.

Quart is an evolution of the `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ API to
work with Asyncio and to provide a number of features not present or
possible in Flask, see :ref:`flask_evolution`.

Quart is developed on `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart>`_.
You are very welcome to open `issues
<https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/issues>`_ or propose `merge requests
<https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/merge_requests>`_.

As Quart is an implementation of the Flask API the `Flask
documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ is a great source of
help for Quart. The Flask documentation is so good that you may be
better placed consulting it first then returning here to check how
Quart differs.

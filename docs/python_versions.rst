Python version support
======================

The master branch and releases >= 0.7.0 onwards only support Python
3.7.0 or greater. The 0.6-maintenance branch and releases ~= 0.6.0
support Python 3.6.1 or greater.

Python 3.7.0 is required to utilise ContextVars and doing so
considerably simplifies context management with tasks. Python 3.6.1
was required to utilise asynchronous generators.

The 0.6-maintenance branch will be supported for the near future with
additional 0.6.X bugfixes.
